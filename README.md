# graphicsEngine

I started this project to learn javascript better and the DOM model and also because I thought I could create a 2D graphics engine. I got some basics down in an afternoon, and then made quite a few improvements to the code and the funtionality and features of it. I still would like to work on it in the future. I would like to add more layers so that a HUD could be placed on the screen.
